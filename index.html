          <h1>Get to Know Alice the Great</h1>
          <img src="http://bit.ly/2n1afYU" alt="Alice The Great">
          <p>I am a 4-year old Ridgeback/Boxer mix with a dash of Pitbull. I was named after Alice from the Resident Evil movies because my mom wanted me to be a badass.</p>
          <p>As it turns out, I'm afraid of most things, including fireworks and strangers with hats - but I'm working on it.</p>

              <h2>Favorite Pastimes</h2>
              <p>I enjoy playing with my brother, Bishop, stealing all of the space in the bed, pretending I'm a lapdog, and chasing after any and every beam of light or reflection.</p>

              <h2>Favorite Tricks</h2>
              <p>I pride myself on being a pretty smart pup. Sure, I can do the basics (sit, lie down, stay, etc.) But I can also back up, crawl, give kisses, and go fetch each toy by name.</p>
